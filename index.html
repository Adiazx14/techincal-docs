        <p>Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive -it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).</p>
        <p>To print a string in Python 3, just write:</p>
        <code>print("This line will be printed.")</code>

        <p>Decision making is required when we want to execute a code only if a certain condition is satisfied. The if…elif…else statement is used in Python for decision making.</p>

        <code> if test expression:
            statement(s)</code>
            <p> Here, the program evaluates the test expression and will execute statement(s) only if the test expression is True.

                If the test expression is False, the statement(s) is not executed.
                
                In Python, the body of the if statement is indicated by the indentation. The body starts with an indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.
                
                Python interprets non-zero values as True. None and 0 are interpreted as False.</p>

        <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

            This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</p>
        <p>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p>
        <code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
           </code>
           <br>
           <code> for x in fruits:
            print(x)</code>

    <section id="While_Loop" class="main-section">
        <header id="While-Loop"> <h1>While Loop</h1></header>
        
        <p> while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.</p>
       
        <code>while expression:</code>
        <br> 
        <code> statement(s)</code>
        <p>Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements. The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.

            When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.
            
            In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements</p>

        <p>You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</li>
           <li>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</li>
           <li>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.</li>
           <li>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</li>
           <li>The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None</li>
       </ul>
        <code>def functionname( parameters ):
            <br>
            "function_docstring"
            <br>
            function_suite
            <br>
            return [expression]</code>
       
        <p>By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.</p>
